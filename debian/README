Debian ramdisk builder
----------------------

This directory contains an auto-build system for making a minimal Debian
system, suitable for including in a ramdisk.  It is tested and known to
build when run on a Debian system.  It requires that you are running a
system with the apt and dpkg software.  See below for building on Ubuntu.

It currently only creates a very minimal debian system (the config file
debian.stretch.multistrap contains the list of repositories and the
packages to install)

Usage:

    make build-depends          # install needed build packages

    make                        # creates build/debian.cpio

After making sure the needed packages are installed, you just need to
run the full build.  The resulting image can be used to build a ramdisk
install - see the boards directory for various builders

The various fixups and customisation that are applied to the basic Debian
installation can be seen in the packages.d directory.  See the README
in that dir for more information.

Building on Ubuntu
------------------

During building, all downloaded Debian packages are verified before use.  This
verification requires the Debian keyring to work.  When using Ubuntu, the
Debian keyring is not installed by default.  The following command will install
the Debian keyring package and allow the verification:

    sudo apt-get install debian-archive-keyring

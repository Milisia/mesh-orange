Debian ramdisk builder
----------------------

This directory contains an auto-build system for making initrd images.  There
is nothing particularly Orange PI Zero specific about the created image,
it should work on any system supported by the Debian armhf architecture.

It currently only creates a very minimal system (the config file
multistrap.conf contains the list of repositories and additional packages
to install)

It also does not yet produce a bootable disk image, just the ramdisk.

Usage:

    make build-depends

    make build/uInitrd

The ramdisk should have been created in the file build/uInitrd

To test the raw ramdisk image, first create a bootable armbian sdcard.
Mount this card and overwrite the boot/uInitrd file with the one built
above.  You will need a serial console to log in, but if the ethernet
port is plugged into a network, it should autoconfigure an IP address
which can be pinged.

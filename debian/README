Debian ramdisk builder
----------------------

This directory contains an auto-build system for making initrd images.
There is nothing particularly Orange PI Zero specific about the created
ramdisk image, it should work on any system supported by the Debian
armhf architecture.

It currently only creates a very minimal system (the config file
multistrap.conf contains the list of repositories and additional packages
to install)

It also does not yet produce a bootable disk image, just the ramdisk and
the /boot dir.

Usage:

    make build-depends          # install needed build packages

    make debian                 # build a Debian armhf chroot in build/debian
    make build/boot/uInitrd     # build the u-boot initrd
    make boot                   # build a full /boot dir in build/boot

To test the ramdisk image (build/boot/uInitrd), first create a bootable
armbian sdcard.  Mount this card and overwrite the boot/uInitrd file
with the one built above.

To test the boot dir, first create a bootable armbian sdcard.  Mount this
card and remove the boot dir from it, copy the build/boot dir onto
the card.


Using the ramdisk
-----------------

You will need a serial console to log in, but if the ethernet port is
plugged into a network, it should autoconfigure an IP address which can
be pinged.
